        <b></b>Open networks such as this have no security features enabled. This typically means that <b>ALL DATA</b> is readable by anyone nearby.
        The exception is if you are visiting a web site or service that uses encryption. Web sites that use encryption
        will always have a URL which begins with \"https\" rather than \"http\". Services will vary by provider - if you are not
        certain that they use encryption it is usually best to play it safe and wait until you are on a more secure network.

        <br/>
        - General web browsing (news, sports, games) <br/>
