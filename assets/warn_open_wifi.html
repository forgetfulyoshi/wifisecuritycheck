		<b>Bottom line:</b> Don't do anything on this network that you
		wouldn't want someone else seeing.
	</p>

	<p>
		<b>Explanation: </b>Open networks such as this have no security
		features enabled. This typically means that <b>ALL DATA</b> is
		readable by anyone nearby.The exception is if you are visiting a web
		site or service that uses encryption. Web sites that use encryption
		will always have a URL which begins with "https" rather than "http".
		Services will vary by provider - if you are not certain that they use
		encryption it is usually best to play it safe and wait until you are
		on a more secure network.
	</p>

	This network is safe to use for:
	<ul>
		<li>General web browsing (news, sports, games)</li>
		<li>Viewing encrypted web sites (most email, facebook, etc.)</li>
	</ul>
